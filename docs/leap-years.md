# Leap Years Kata

Write a function that returns true or false depending on whether its input integer is a leap year or not.
A leap year is divisible by 4, but is not otherwise divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400

Examples:

- 1996 -> true
- 2001 -> false
- 2000 -> true
- 1900 -> false
