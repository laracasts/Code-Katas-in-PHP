Interpreter pattern
=========================

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_pattern)

The interpreter pattern is a design pattern that specifies how to evaluate sentences in a language. 
The basic idea is to have a class for each symbol (terminal or nonterminal) in a specialized computer language. 
The syntax tree of a sentence in the language is an instance of the composite pattern and is used to evaluate (interpret) the sentence for a client.
