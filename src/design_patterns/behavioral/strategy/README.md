Strategy Pattern
========================

The strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) enables an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime. 

The strategy pattern:

- defines a family of algorithms,
- encapsulates each algorithm, and
- makes the algorithms interchangeable within that family.
